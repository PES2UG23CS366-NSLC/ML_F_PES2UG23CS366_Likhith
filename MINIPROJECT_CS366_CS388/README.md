Modern software systems and their data are prime targets for cybercriminals. Detecting malicious user behavior in real-time is essential to protect sensitive data and maintain system integrity. This task is challenging because cyberattacks are diverse, constantly evolving, and can subtly modify attack patterns to evade traditional intrusion detection systems. Existing systems often fail to adapt to these variations, leaving networks and applications vulnerable.
