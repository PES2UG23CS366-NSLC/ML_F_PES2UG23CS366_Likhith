PROBLEM STATEMENT :-Modern software systems and their data are prime targets for cybercriminals. Detecting malicious user behavior in real-time is essential to protect sensitive data and maintain system integrity. This task is challenging because cyberattacks are diverse, constantly evolving, and can subtly modify attack patterns to evade traditional intrusion detection systems. Existing systems often fail to adapt to these variations, leaving networks and applications vulnerable.

Project Description
This project develops a Security Attacks Detection using a machine learning model. The system is designed to analyze network traffic and user behavior to accurately classify activity as either Normal or Malicious.

The core of the project is a Random Forest Classifier trained on a custom synthetic dataset. This dataset was specifically created to be challenging, with a high degree of overlap between normal and malicious data points, simulating the complexity of real-world cyber threats.

The main outcome is a user-friendly Streamlit web application that provides a simple interface for testing the trained model.

Project Workflow & Architecture
The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline, from data preparation to model deployment.

Data Generation & Preprocessing: A synthetic dataset of 150,000 samples with 41 features is created. This data is then split into training and testing sets and saved as .npy files.

Model Training: A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the resampled training data to learn the patterns of both normal and attack behaviors. The trained model is then saved as a .joblib file.

Model Deployment: A Streamlit application (app.py) is created to serve as the user interface. This app loads the trained model and allows users to input simplified features to get real-time predictions.

Prediction Outcome: The UI is designed to clearly display the model's prediction as either "Normal Activity" or "Malicious Activity".

How to Set Up and Run the Project
Follow these step-by-step instructions to get the project up and running.

Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone this GitHub repository to your local machine:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
Step 2: Download the X_train.npy Dataset
The X_train.npy file is a large dataset and is not included in the repository. Please download it from the following Google Drive link:

Download X_train.npy from Google Drive

After downloading, place the X_train.npy file into the datasets/ folder.

Step 3: Set up the Python Environment
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

Create a virtual environment:

Bash

python -m venv venv
The venv folder is a Python virtual environment used to create an isolated environment for this project, avoiding conflicts with other projects.

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

Bash

venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

Bash

source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:
This command will install all the necessary libraries, including Streamlit and scikit-learn, into your venv virtual environment from the requirements.txt file.

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 4: Train the Model and Generate the .joblib File
The Streamlit app requires the rf_model_84target_final.joblib file, which is created by running the Jupyter Notebook.

Open the MLPROJECT_Security Attacks Detection.ipynb notebook in VS Code or Jupyter.

Run all the cells in the notebook. This will perform data loading, model training, and save the trained model as rf_model_84target_final.joblib in the root directory.

Step 5: Run the Streamlit UI
After the .joblib file has been created, you can launch the web application.

Ensure your virtual environment is still active.

Run the following command in your terminal:

Bash

streamlit run app.py
A new tab in your web browser will automatically open, displaying the interactive UI for your project.

How the Streamlit UI Works
The user interface is designed for simplicity and clarity.

Input Parameters: The UI presents a simplified set of sliders, select boxes, and checkboxes that represent key features of a network connection (e.g., Session Duration, Bytes Sent).

Prediction: When you adjust these inputs and click the "Detect Activity" button, the app takes the user-defined inputs, maps them to the  features that the model was trained on, and feeds this vector to the pre-trained Random Forest model.

Model Outcome: The model returns a prediction, which the UI then displays as either Normal Activity or Malicious Activity. This design makes the powerful machine learning model accessible to users without requiring them to understand the underlying technical details of all 41 features.
