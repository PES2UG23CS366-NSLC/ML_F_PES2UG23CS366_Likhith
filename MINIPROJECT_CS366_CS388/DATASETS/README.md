### Datasets

This folder contains the data files for our Security Attacks Detection project.

The data is a custom synthetic dataset designed to mimic real-world network traffic challenges. It's pre-processed and ready to be used for training and testing the machine learning model.

#### Files included:

* `X_train.npy`: The training data features.
* `y_train.npy`: The corresponding labels for the training data.
* `X_test.npy`: The testing data features.
* `y_test.npy`: The corresponding labels for the testing data.

## DOWNLOAD X_train.npy dataset 
To get the `X_train.npy` file, please download it from the following link:

**[Download X_train.npy from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kwVwKSq6yAoVKO5yTpJ119WOmsgj5a03?usp=sharing)**
Once downloaded, place the file in this folder along with the other dataset files.


#### How to use them:

These files are essential for the `MLPROJECT_Security Attacks Detection.ipynb` notebook. The notebook loads these files directly to train the model and then evaluate its performance.

Just keep them in the same folder as your notebook, and the code should handle the rest.
