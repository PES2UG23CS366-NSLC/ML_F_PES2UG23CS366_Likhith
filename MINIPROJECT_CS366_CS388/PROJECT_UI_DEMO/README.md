this project develops an intelligent and adaptive intrusion detection system using a machine learning model. The system is designed to analyze network traffic and user behavior to accurately classify activity as either `Normal` or `Malicious`.

The project includes a user-friendly Streamlit web application that provides a simple interface for testing the trained model.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

│
├── MLPROJECT_Security Attacks Detection.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook for training the model
│
├── rf_model_84target_final.joblib           # Trained model file (generated by the notebook)
│
├── app.py                                   # The Streamlit web application script

## How to Set Up and Run the Project

Follow these step-by-step instructions to get the project up and running.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone this GitHub repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
cd your-repository-name
Step 2 : Download the X_train.npy Dataset
The X_train.npy file is a large dataset and is not included in the repository. Please download it from the following Google Drive link:

Download X_train.npy from Google Drive

After downloading, place the X_train.npy file into the datasets/ folder.

Step 3: Set up the Python Environment
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

Create a virtual environment:

Bash

python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
Bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
Bash
  source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:
This command will install all the necessary libraries, including Streamlit, scikit-learn, and joblib.
Bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 4: Train the Model and Generate the .joblib File
The Streamlit app requires the rf_model_84target_final.joblib file, which is created by running the Jupyter Notebook.

Open the MLPROJECT_Security Attacks Detection.ipynb notebook in VS Code or Jupyter.

Run all the cells in the notebook. This will perform data loading, model training, and save the trained model as rf_model_84target_final.joblib in the root directory.

Step 5: Run the Streamlit UI
After the .joblib file has been created, you can launch the web application.

Ensure your virtual environment is still active.

Run the following command in your terminal:
Bash
    streamlit run app.py
A new tab in your web browser will automatically open, displaying the interactive UI for your project.

How the Streamlit UI Works
The user interface is designed for simplicity and clarity.

Input Parameters: The UI presents a simplified set of sliders, select boxes, and checkboxes that represent key features of a network connection (e.g., Session Duration, Bytes Sent).

Prediction: When you adjust these inputs and click the "Detect Activity" button, the app does the following:

It takes the user-defined inputs.

It maps these simplified inputs to the 41 features that the model was trained on.

It feeds this 41-feature vector to the pre-trained Random Forest model.

The model returns a prediction, which the UI then displays as either Normal Activity or Malicious Activity.

```
What the User Should Do Once the Webpage is Ready

“Once the webpage loads, the user will see a simple and interactive dashboard titled ‘🛡️ Security Attacks Detection’.

The interface has sliders, dropdowns, and input boxes for entering details about a network connection — such as:

Duration of the connection

Bytes Sent and Bytes Received

Number of Connections

Protocol Type

Service Type

and whether the user is logged in or not.

The user just needs to:
1️. Enter or adjust these values using the sliders and dropdowns.
2️.  Once all values are filled, click the ‘Analyze Connection’ button at the bottom.

Immediately, the system processes these inputs and displays the result:

If the entered values fall within normal behavior range, a green box appears saying ‘Normal Activity Detected’.

If the inputs go beyond safe limits (for example, too high duration, too many connections, or wrong protocol), a red box appears showing ‘Malicious Activity Detected’.
