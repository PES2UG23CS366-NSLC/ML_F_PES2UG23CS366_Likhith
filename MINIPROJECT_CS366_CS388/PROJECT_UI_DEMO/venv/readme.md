The venv folder is a Python virtual environment. Its primary function is to create an isolated environment for your project, separate from your system's global Python installation.




How the venv Folder is Generated
The venv folder is created by the command python -m venv venv.



venv (the second one): This specifies the name of the directory where the new virtual environment will be created. It's a common convention to name the folder venv.

When you run this command, a new folder named venv is created in your project's directory. This folder contains a local copy of the Python interpreter and the necessary structure for installing project-specific libraries.

 It keeps all the libraries your project needs (like streamlit, numpy, and scikit-learn) separate from other Python projects you might have on your computer. This prevents version conflicts where one project requires an older version of a library and another needs a newer one.

Project-Specific Dependencies: All the libraries listed in your requirements.txt file are installed directly into this venv folder. This ensures that your project is self-contained and portable.

Reproducibility: By including the requirements.txt file in your GitHub repository, other users can easily recreate the exact same environment as yours by running pip install -r requirements.txt after activating the virtual environment. This guarantees that your code will run correctly on any machine.
